## Overview
CodeSmith is an intelligent project template generator designed to streamline development workflows by leveraging AI-powered recommendations and automated project setup. At its core, CodeSmith integrates **Ollama** with `deepseek-coder:6.7b` to provide intelligent code generation, suggesting optimal tech stacks, structuring project files, and reducing the manual effort required in setting up a development environment.

## Functionalities
### AI-Driven Code Generation
CodeSmith uses `deepseek-coder:6.7b` to generate high-quality code snippets, project boilerplates, and module structures tailored to the developer’s requirements. It understands the context of the project and provides well-structured, maintainable code to kickstart development.

### Automated Project Scaffolding
By analyzing the developer’s preferences and project requirements, CodeSmith automatically generates the necessary files and directories, ensuring that best practices are followed. It eliminates repetitive tasks such as setting up configurations, installing dependencies, and structuring folders.

### Smart Tech Stack Selection
With the help of `deepseek-coder:6.7b`, CodeSmith suggests the most suitable frameworks, databases, and libraries based on the project's domain. Whether it's a full-stack application, a machine learning project, or a microservices architecture, CodeSmith provides recommendations tailored to optimize development efficiency.

### Seamless Integration with Docker
For developers who prefer containerized environments, CodeSmith auto-generates `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` configurations, ensuring that the project is instantly deployable with minimal setup.

### Enhanced Code Refactoring and Optimization
CodeSmith doesn't just generate code; it also assists in refactoring and improving existing codebases. Using `deepseek-coder:6.7b`, it suggests better coding patterns, identifies potential bugs, and enhances performance by recommending more efficient implementations.

### Intelligent Documentation Assistance
One of the most time-consuming tasks in development is writing documentation. CodeSmith utilizes AI to generate well-structured README files, API documentation, and inline code comments, making it easier for teams to understand and maintain their codebases.

### Continuous Learning and Improvement
As developers interact with CodeSmith, it refines its suggestions based on feedback and evolving best practices, ensuring that future project templates and recommendations remain up to date and effective.

## How CodeSmith Simplifies Development
- **Reduces Setup Time**: Eliminates hours of manual configuration and setup.
- **Improves Code Quality**: AI-driven recommendations ensure clean, scalable, and efficient code.
- **Boosts Productivity**: Developers can focus on writing logic rather than setting up environments.
- **Ensures Best Practices**: Automatically follows industry standards in project structuring and dependency management.
- **Enhances Collaboration**: Well-documented and structured projects make team contributions seamless.

By integrating AI-powered assistance with robust automation, CodeSmith transforms the way developers start and manage projects, making software development faster, smarter, and more efficient.
